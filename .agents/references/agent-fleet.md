# Agent Fleet Manifest

The 18 specialist subagents, what each is for, the model tier it runs at ([`model-routing.md`](../rules/model-routing.md)), and which skill dispatches it. All agents are configured to run at **maximum effort (`effort: max`)**. Reviewers are **read-only** (they report `FINDING`s per [`orchestration-schemas.md`](orchestration-schemas.md)); only the fixer edits files.

## High-judgment tier — Gemini 3.1 Pro (effort: max)

A wrong "looks fine" from one of these is expensive (a desk-reject, a hallucinated citation, a biased estimator shipped).

| Agent | Role | Read/Write | Disposition-aware | Dispatched by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `editor` | Desk review, referee selection, editorial synthesis | read-only | selects referee dispositions | `/review-paper --peer` / `--variance` |
| `domain-referee` | Substance referee (contribution, positioning, external validity) | read-only | yes (6-way taxonomy) | `/review-paper --peer` |
| `methods-referee` | Methodology referee (paper-type-aware identification/inference) | read-only | yes (6-way taxonomy) | `/review-paper --peer` |
| `claim-verifier` | Fresh-context CoVe verifier (citations, numbers, novelty) | read-only | no | `/verify-claims`, post-flight in `/lit-review` · `/research-ideation` · `/respond-to-referees` · `/review-paper --peer`; hallucination gate |
| `domain-reviewer` | Field-specific substance review of slides (5 lenses; **template — customize**) | read-only | no | `/slide-excellence`, `/seven-pass-review` (methods lens) |
| `quarto-critic` | Adversarial Beamer↔Quarto parity critic | read-only | no | `/qa-quarto`, `/slide-excellence` (parity) |
| `tikz-reviewer` | Measurement-based TikZ collision/aesthetic audit | read-only | no | `/slide-excellence` (if TikZ), `/extract-tikz`, `/new-diagram` |
| `sim-reviewer` | Monte Carlo review (DGP/estimand, MCSE, coverage-vs-truth) | read-only | no | `/simulation-study` |
| `verifier` | End-to-end compile/render/deploy verification gate | read-only | no | `/commit` |

## Review / critique tier — Gemini 3.7 Flash (effort: max)

| Agent | Role | Read/Write | Dispatched by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `r-reviewer` | R code quality, reproducibility, idioms | read-only | `/review-r`, `/slide-excellence` (if R), `/data-analysis` |
| `r-package-reviewer` | R package CRAN-readiness (DESCRIPTION/NAMESPACE/roxygen/testthat/policy) | read-only | `/r-package-check` |
| `slide-auditor` | Visual layout audit (overflow, font, spacing) | read-only | `/visual-audit`, `/slide-excellence` |
| `proofreader` | Grammar, typos, overflow, terminology | read-only | `/proofread`, `/slide-excellence`, `/seven-pass-review` (prose lens) |
| `pedagogy-reviewer` | Narrative arc, prerequisites, worked examples, notation, pacing | read-only | `/pedagogy-review`, `/slide-excellence` |
| `humanize-auditor` | AI-voice tell detection (10 categories) | read-only | `/humanize` |

## Apply / translate tier — Gemini 3.7 Flash (effort: max)

| Agent | Role | Read/Write | Dispatched by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `quarto-fixer` | Applies `quarto-critic`'s diffs, re-renders, verifies | **writes** | `/qa-quarto` |
| `beamer-translator` | Beamer→Quarto slide-by-slide translation | **writes** | `/translate-to-quarto` |

## Mechanical / voting tier — Gemini 2.5 Flash (effort: max)

| Agent | Role | Read/Write | Dispatched by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `promote-memory-council` | Five-critic vote on `[LEARN]` promotion (generality/staleness/redundancy/evidence/format) | read-only | `/promote-memory` |

## The referee disposition taxonomy

Only the referees (`domain-referee`, `methods-referee`) and the `editor` that assigns them are disposition-aware. The 6-way taxonomy: **STRUCTURAL · CREDIBILITY · MEASUREMENT · POLICY · THEORY · SKEPTIC**. `--peer` samples 2; `--variance N` samples N (with replacement, ≥1 SKEPTIC when N≥3); `--stress` forces SKEPTIC×2. Dispositions are fixed in the `RUN_CONFIG` before launch (referees are forked and cannot be re-prompted mid-run).
